# MathematicalRobotics

## What is this?
The development of robotics is always closely related to mathematics. But sometime pure mathematical expressions are boring and difficult to understand, so I hope to show the magic of mathematics through some interesting robotics demonstrations.


## The goals of our project.
We want to select some widely used and practical algorithms. for each algorithm, we aim to 
* provide a readable a python implementation.
* show a detailed mathematical proof.
* To show the math behind it, try not to use third-party libraries.
